h1. Notification Control

This Redmine plugin lets you configure for each project/tracker-combination which field changes result in a notification.

h2. Installation

# Copy the notification_control plugin to your redmine plugin directory (vendor/plugins)
# Apply the Database Schema Migration file (20100728100000_create_notification_controls.rb) by using the following command: rake db:migrate_plugins
# Restart any running Redmine application servers
# Configure the notification settings per project as desired

h2. Usage

# By default, the plugin does not change the behavior of redmine at all, meaning that notifications are sent as usual.
# Settings for notifications are made on project level. This means that you need to switch to a project, so that you can click the new "Notification" tab
# For each tracker in a project you can check the fields that should result in a e-mail notification, if their value gets changed.
# Use the "Save" button to store your settings.
# If you uncheck all checkboxes for a project, this means that no notifications will be sent for this project.
# If you check all the checkboxes for a project, notifications will be sent as if there was no plugin installed.

h2. TODO
Solve incompatibility with the Redmine-reminder plugin
